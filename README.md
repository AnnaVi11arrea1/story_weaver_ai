# Run and deploy your AI Studio app

This contains everything you need to run your app locally. Use the Dev branch.

## Run Locally

**Prerequisites:**  Node.js


1. Install dependencies:
   `npm install`
2. Set the `GEMINI_API_KEY` in [.env.local](.env.local) to your Gemini API key
3. Run the app:
   `npm run dev`

Your gonna need to install mongoDB in a weird way. I'm using the lastest ubuntu here(plucky puffin), which is not supported officially by mongoDB yet.
